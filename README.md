    This is an android app created by Grace Zhe Liu, Heidi Han, Steven Feng, Jason Liu, and Ethan Shi at StartHacks 2019. 
    The app tackles with the problem that a great number of people find it challenging selecting outfits that satisfy the occasion and weather. 
    The app prompts several relevant questions regarding the user's outfit choice. For example like "What is the weather today" and "What is the occasion today?" Several choices are given for the user and the next question is triggered as the user inputs a choice.
    We will be implementing firebase to the app in order to store outfit photos as well as google search API that suggests the user a shopping site when no appropriate outfits can be found.
